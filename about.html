        <h3>About Us</h3>
"Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian Economy"- said Mahatma Gandhi six decades ago. Even today, the situation is    still the same, with almost the entire economy being sustained by agriculture, which is the mainstay of the villages. It contributes 16% of the overall GDP and accounts for employment of approximately 52% of the Indian population. Rapid growth in agriculture is essential not only for self-reliance but also to earn valuable foreign exchange.<br><br>

    Indian farmers are second to none in production and productivity despite of the fact that millions are marginal and small farmers. They adopt improved agriculture technology as efficiently as farmers in developed countries. It is felt that with provision of timely and adequate inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and by making available affordable agricultural credit /crop insurance, Indian farmers are going to ensure food and nutritional security to the Nation.<br><br>

    Krishak Sarthi is an endeavour to serve the working farmers by providing them with a single platform for all types of informational needs regarding agriculture. It also aims to update and aware them of different government schemes.  Farmers will also be able to ask specific queries as well as give valuable feedback through the Feedback module specially developed for the purpose.
